# Dorsium API (`dorsium-api`)

This is the official API gateway for all Dorsium frontend services and apps.  
It acts as a secure proxy layer between user-facing systems and the Dorsium Internal Service.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Fastify (high performance)
- **Structure:** Modular, Resource-Oriented
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Docs:** Swagger (auto-generated)

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/        # API endpoints grouped by resource
â”œâ”€â”€ services/      # Logic adapters to the Internal Service
â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/       # Fastify plugins: auth, logger, swagger, i18n
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/         # Error handling, validation utils
â”œâ”€â”€ types/         # Shared interfaces & DTOs

â”œâ”€â”€ server.ts      # Fastify app init
â””â”€â”€ index.ts       # App entrypoint
```

## How It Works

1. An HTTP request hits a route under `src/routes`.
2. The route validates input with Zod and forwards the call to a service.
3. Services use `callInternal` to contact the Dorsium Internal Service.
4. Responses are returned in the form `{ ok: true, data }`.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dorsium/dorsium-api.git
cd dorsium-api
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Swagger UI â†’ [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs)

### Environment Variables

Set these values in `.env` as needed:

- `PORT` - HTTP port to bind (default `3000`)
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_URL` - URL of the internal Dorsium service

---

## Usage

1. Verify the service is running with the health check:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```
2. Retrieve an example message:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/example?name=John
   ```

Routes are defined in `src/routes` and delegate all logic to matching services.
Services forward requests to the internal API using the `callInternal` helper.

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```
